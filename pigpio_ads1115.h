/**
 * Class used to interface with the ADS1115
 * Create an instance of this class for each ADS1115 breakout / chiplet you'll read.
 * You can switch the address but it might become problematic in continous conversion mode
 * Remember you can use up to 4 ADS1115 for each i2c interface
 *
 * It is fully compatible with Adafruit_ADS1015 library (it incorporates the same interface and allows extended functionality)
 * Hence it is possible to just change the library and keep having the same code!
 * The only drawback is that this library doesn't work with the ADS1015
 *
 * This library incorporates a set opf improvements over the ADS1015
 * - Provides the addresses needed to use other boards on the same i2c interface
 * - Read from all differential channels (0-1, 0-3, 1-3 and 2-3)
 * - Get the readings in millivolts (for easier use and testing)
 * - Allows for faster reading times on single shot readings and provides info about the reading delays used
 * - Allows the configuration of the samples per second (great for time critial applications)
 * - Expands the continous conversion mode. You can now use differential channels
 * - Improves the comparator mode. You can now set Low Threshold, Assert Polarity, Comparator Window Mode, Assertion Latching and Comparator Queue
